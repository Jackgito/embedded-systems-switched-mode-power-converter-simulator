# Switched Mode Power Converter Simulator

This project is a **Switched Mode Power Converter Simulator**, developed as part of the course **BL40A1101 ESP** at **LUT School of Energy Systems, Electrical Engineering**. This project simulates a switched mode power converter utilizing a Nucleo board. The built-in button is used to cycle through the different states the system supports: idle, configuration and modulation. Configuration mode allows users to interact with the command line interface via UART to configure the converter parameters. Modulation mode starts the simulation using the configured parameters, causing the built-in LED to light up.

The project is divided into multiple modules with different purposes to promote code readability and maintainability. main.c file is the entry point of the program and it is responsible for initializing the system and running the main loop.



More information about the project can be found in the assignment instructions PDF and project work report files.
